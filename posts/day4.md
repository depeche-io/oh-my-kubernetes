# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 4th day and km: Cluster Frozen. Webhook Woes.

I just installed a shiny new security/policy tool in my Kubernetes cluster.
Everything seemed fine‚Ä¶ until everything broke.

* I can list Pods and other resources üü¢
* I can see their status/describe üü¢
* But I can‚Äôt make a single change üî¥

Every kubectl apply, delete, scale ‚Äî all fail with a webhook timeout.
It‚Äôs like the cluster is pretending to be alive, but any mutation is silently intercepted by a failing admission webhook.

And of course, the managed service provider says: ‚ÄúAll green from our side‚Äù.
Not helpful.

## Why?

A failing admission webhook with `failurePolicy: Fail` = a bricked cluster.

It doesn‚Äôt even need to crash ‚Äî just timeout is enough to make your whole control plane unresponsive to changes. It of course much depends on the (admission webhooks configuration)[https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#timeouts], but for example `Kyverno` in some configurations inspect ALL resource changes.

## Root cause

So you have multiple options, either:
* remove problematic `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` or `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` - the one that is using the problematic webhook
  * of course you might be dropping the security that the tool provides
  * or you can change `failurePolicy` a timeout, or the narrow the definition - so the webhook Pods can start and become ready.
* make webhook work, I've seen multiple problems here
  * webhook Pods are not ready for some reason - inspecting logs typically help. It varies, for example I've seen a problem that the Pod could not became ready because it couldn't acquire `Lease`. But the `Lease` creation was declined because of the webhook...
  * webhook Pods are not being even scheduled - becase it's trying to call the same webhook - removing admission webhook configuration will help here
  * kube-apiserver is throwing TLS error communicating with a webhook - typically this means some messed up installation. In some cases restarting Pods work (for example because they reread Secret that kube-apiserver is using)

It might get even much more complicated, because for example Kyverno is constantly trying to recreate the admission webhook configuration - so you drop it and it's back again in no time.

Would you like to try this situation yourself? I've create a (simulator for this problem on Killercoda)[https://killercoda.com/davidpechcz/scenario/admission-webhooks].
